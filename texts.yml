  It's not really a story without a ***, so here's
  one. One day, an exceptionally naughty ***
  decides to go to his neighbor's house and steal
  a piece of ***. The neighbor has mounds of the stuff,
  and if they were stacked one on top of the other,
  they'd be higher than the house itself. One little
  piece wouldn't go unnoticedâ€”perhaps even three or four
  pieces could be taken. It was, after all, an act of ***.
