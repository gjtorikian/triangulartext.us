  It's not really a story without a ***, so here's
  one. One day, an exceptionally naughty ***
  decides to go to his neighbor's house and steal
  a piece of ***. The neighbor has mounds of the stuff,
  and if they were stacked one on top of the other,
  they'd be higher than the house itself. One little
  piece wouldn't go unnoticed—perhaps even three or four
  pieces could be taken. It was, after all, an act of ***.

  Everyone at the Central Library called him *** because that’s just what he looked like,
  dressed as he was, entirely in black. Every morning I went to the library to *** and I would
  pass by him seated at ***. This would have been around 2016. In those days, I
  was on the verge of dropping out of college, having skipped out on all my classes.
  Besides which, it was too ***.

  It turns out there is such a thing as love at first sight after all.
  I know that’s hard to swallow, but I spoke to *** it.
  His father, a Lebanese sailor, died of drink; to support the family, his *** mother smuggled
  him across the border. From his father, he inherited a mild yet incurable ***;
  from his mother, a provisional ***.

  I used to go to the tracks with him when there wasn’t a ***.
  It was fun, and I was glad. We’d climb to the topmost bleachers,
  even if it took me forever, and then we’d each take a crutch and hurl them
  one after the other like javelins. He’d run to where they *** and I’d close my eyes
  and listen to the quick thud-thud-thud of his jog

  There’s an *** asleep in my bed. Or what was once my bed.
  His legs are hanging over the the edge of my mattress.
  His right sock has slipped off and the bottom of his exposed heel is, inexplicably, ***.
  The bastard’s managed to pull off one of the bed sheet’s corners and the duvet is
  lifted over his head and if it weren’t for the occasional snore I wouldn’t even know whether
  he was still alive. My whiskey-thick eyes are burning as I struggle to understand how I let this ***.
